/**
 * ###################
 * UNIQUE PATH PROBLEM 
 * ###################
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid 
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. 
 * The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
 * 
 * How many possible unique paths are there? 
 * 
 * LOGIC
 * If n or m is 1, there is only one path: a straight line move to the right
 * or down. Use recursion to get to that baseline scenario and add up all the
 * numbers for going down and right.
